I want a program that allows me to add chapter/section names from a book, into a list, after I read them. Once a section is in a list I can use the `check` button whenever I want to see if a section has already been read

A text box to enter section names
an `add` button
a `check` button so that when I input a section name and hit `check` it tells me if I've read that section before
I'll need a default list of all the sections so I can know how many I haven't read
    - if an item from `default list` != in `read list`
        I haven't read it

I can make sure that each section has the index next to it
- console.log(indexOf(section) + ' ' section)

TASKS:
Create list with all sections of Peak
Create button that runs a check of the list that contains sections I've read, against the list of all sections to see which one's I haven't read
